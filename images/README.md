# Images Directory

This directory contains the images for the gallery.

## How it works:

1. **Automatic Loading**: When you serve the project via HTTP (like with Herd), the gallery automatically scans this folder for images on page load.

2. **Upload Functionality**: When you upload images through the gallery interface, they are saved to this directory and immediately appear in the gallery.

3. **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP images are supported.

## Usage:

- **With Herd/HTTP Server**: Full functionality including automatic folder scanning and server uploads
- **File Protocol**: Basic functionality with manual file selection only

## Sample Images:

You can add sample images to this directory to test the gallery functionality.
