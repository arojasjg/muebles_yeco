# ✅ Gallery UX Fixes Complete!

## Summary

Fixed two critical UX issues with the gallery:

1. ✅ **Limited landing page to 12 images** (was showing all 26+)
2. ✅ **Fixed lightbox z-index** (was opening behind modal)

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Too Many Images on Landing Page

**Problem**: Landing page was displaying all 26+ images, making it slow and overwhelming.

**Solution**: Limited the gallery to show only 12 images initially.

**Code Change**:

```javascript
// js/furniture-optimized.js
const displayImages = galleryImages.slice(0, 12);
```

### Issue 2: Lightbox Behind Modal

**Problem**: When clicking an image in the "Ver Galería Completa" modal, the lightbox would open behind the modal due to z-index conflict.

**Solution**:

1. Increased lightbox z-index from 2000 to 10001
2. Added function to close modal before opening lightbox

**Code Changes**:

```css
/* css/furniture-landing.css & css/furniture-optimized.css */
.lightbox {
  z-index: 10001; /* Changed from 2000 */
}
```

```javascript
// js/furniture-optimized.js
function openLightboxFromModal(index) {
  // Close modal first
  const modal = document.querySelector(".gallery-modal");
  if (modal) {
    modal.remove();
    document.body.style.overflow = "";
  }
  // Then open lightbox
  openLightbox(index);
}
```

## User Flow Now

### Landing Page

1. User sees 12 featured images
2. Can click any image to open lightbox
3. Can click "Ver Galería Completa" to see all images

### Full Gallery Modal

1. Opens with all 26+ images
2. User can filter by category
3. Clicking an image:
   - Closes the modal
   - Opens the lightbox on top
   - Shows full-size image with navigation

### Lightbox

1. Displays properly on top of everything
2. Shows image counter (e.g., "5 / 26")
3. Navigate with arrows or keyboard
4. Close with X or ESC key

## Z-Index Hierarchy

```
Page Content:     z-index: 0 (default)
Navbar:           z-index: 1000
Gallery Modal:    z-index: 10000
Lightbox:         z-index: 10001 ← Highest (always on top)
```

## Files Modified

1. **js/furniture-optimized.js**

   - Limited gallery to 12 images
